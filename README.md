# Github to blog :)

Most of the time, we work on some projects, and then we find something that is somewhat suitable for a blog, but that document is also essential for our project, and it may need update with the project evolves, so we can not just write a separate article and keep it in a folder far away from our project like `H:\blogs`.

So, it would be nice if we can just leave our document in our projects, and snap our fingers and all the documents and figures will somewhat magically gather together to form a blog.

OK, let use do it.
